# bikesharing

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the client should open a bike sharing service in their own city of Des Moines, Iowa. To determine the statistics of the types of users, how often bikes are used, and what are some other underlying issues to address we will use NYC Citibike August data to use a model to answer our questions. With the use of Tableau we will create several dashboards and finally a story to help our client view the bigger picture of the bike share scene.

## Results
![NYC_Breakdown](https://github.com/vanessaneang/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/NYC_Breakdown.png)

The total number of rides during the month of August was around 2 million rides, with the breakdown of users being a majority Male. We wanted to examine the peak hours of bike usage in the NYC area, it appears that these hours occur around 8AM, pre-work/morning rush hour, and 5-6PM, post-wor/evening rush hour. Where most of the riders started their rides appeared to be in the more metropolitan areas of NY.

![Trips_by_Week](https://github.com/vanessaneang/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips_by_weekday.png)

In this graph it reiterates that during the weekdays Monday through Friday, typically rush hour, there is a high amount of bike usage, with Thursday from 5-6PM having the highest volume of bike usuage. Saturdays also look fairly busy as bike usuage is spread across the day.


![Trips_by_Week_Gendered](https://github.com/vanessaneang/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Usertype_Weekday_Trips_gendered.png)

If we examine the same bike usage through the week and filter by Male, Female, and Unknown riders it appears that Male riders utilize the Citi Bike more frequently than the other two. This leads us to believe that men are using the bike app more frequently to bike to and from work and to get around in general in NYC.

![Most_Common_User](https://github.com/vanessaneang/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Most_Common_user.png)

In order to portray this we examined the data and filtered it to show only males and we can clearly see they are utilizing the most trips in the weekdays as subscribers to the service. They use the bikes for about less than an hour trip duration showing that they are using these bikes to get to and from work as we see that the most activity appears during the pre-work and after-work hours during the work week.
