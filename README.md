# bikesharing

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the client should open a bike sharing service in their own city of Des Moines, Iowa. To determine the statistics of the types of users, how often bikes are used, and what are some other underlying issues to address we will use NYC Citibike August data to use a model to answer our questions. With the use of Tableau we will create several dashboards and finally a story to help our client view the bigger picture of the bike share scene.

## Results
![NYC_Breakdown](https://github.com/vanessaneang/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/NYC_Breakdown.png)

The total number of rides during the month of August was around 2 million rides, with the breakdown of users being a majority Male. We wanted to examine the peak hours of bike usage in the NYC area, it appears that these hours occur around 8AM, pre-work/morning rush hour, and 5-6PM, post-wor/evening rush hour. Where most of the riders started their rides appeared to be in the more metropolitan areas of NY.

![Trips_by_Week](https://github.com/vanessaneang/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips_by_weekday.png)

In this graph it reiterates that during the weekdays Monday through Friday, typically rush hour, there is a high amount of bike usage, with Thursday from 5-6PM having the highest volume of bike usuage. Saturdays also look fairly busy as bike usuage is spread across the day.

If we examine the same bike usage through the week and filter by Male, Female, and Unknown riders it appears that Male riders utilize the Citi Bike more frequently than the other two. This leads us to believe that men are using the bike app more frequently to bike to and from work and to get around in general in NYC.

![Most_Common_User](https://github.com/vanessaneang/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Most_Common_user.png)

In order to portray this we examined the data and filtered it to show only males and we can clearly see they are utilizing the most trips in the weekdays as subscribers to the service. They use the bikes for about less than an hour trip duration showing that they are using these bikes to get to and from work as we see that the most activity appears during the pre-work and after-work hours during the work week.

## Summary

Overall the need for the bike city app appears to be fairly successful in NYC among male users during the weekdays. This implies that in order to start this type of service in Des Moines, the client should place stations near big company offices and areas that these workers reside in. By doing so it would be highly effective for workers to commute to their workplace via bikes. The initial hour should be a set rate since a majority of riders utilize bikes for less than 1 hr, so a set rate to rent the bike for the first hour will allow the business to get enough revenue from all users that are both subscribers and first-time customers. Possibly, increasing the fee during the rush hours on the weekdays could allow for more revenue since a majority of riders use these bikes to commute to from work. Then decreasing the fee durngin the slower hours and day could peak more interest form consumers to utilize the bikes to get aroung the city of Des Moines. 

For future studies, in order to determine how often bikes need to be repaired or are actually utilized it would be good to group the bikes into four different categories to see how many bikes are used at a high, medium-high, medium, and low-rate. This will allow our client to see how often they would need to preform maintenance on the bikes, and what additional costs that may entail. Another graph that would be useful to see would be the distance many riders cover when using the bikes that way the client can see how many stations would be needed for easy use for the consumer and reduce how many unnecessary stations would not be needed.
